**A professional, Makefile-driven pipeline to convert Markdown documents into high-quality audiobooks.**

`mdaudiobook` is a powerful command-line tool designed for academic and technical content. It intelligently handles complex elements like mathematical expressions, citations, and footnotes, producing clean, navigable audiobooks. As a core component of the `ucli-tools` ecosystem, it works in tandem with `mdtexpdf` to provide a unified document creation workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **System-Wide Command:** Install once with `make install-system` and use `mdaudiobook` from any directory.
- **Makefile-Driven Workflow:** Simple `make` commands handle setup, building, installation, and processing.
- **Unified Metadata:** Shares a 3-section YAML frontmatter with `mdtexpdf` for consistent configuration across PDF and audio outputs.
- **Intelligent Text Handling:** Converts LaTeX math to natural speech and correctly processes academic syntax.
- **Multiple Processing Modes:** Choose between free, local AI, premium API, and reliable hybrid modes.
- **Standardized Output:** Generates chapterized `.m4b` audiobooks in the current working directory for a clean, predictable workflow.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ucli-tools/mdaudiobook.git
    cd mdaudiobook
    ```

2.  **Install and Configure**

    The `install-system` command fully prepares and installs the tool in one step. It automatically sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, and copies the `mdaudiobook` executable to `/usr/local/bin`.

    During installation, it will create a user-specific configuration directory at `~/.config/mdaudiobook/`. It will also create a default `.env` file for your API keys.

    ```bash
    make install-system
    ```

    To use premium TTS services, you must add your API keys to `~/.config/mdaudiobook/.env`. You can open it for editing with your favorite editor:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.config/mdaudiobook/.env
    ```

    ### Google Cloud Authentication (The Easy Way)

    For Google Cloud, the setup is fully automated. Simply place your downloaded Google Cloud service account key file (e.g., `gothic-ripsaw-34581-a4b1cdef.json`) inside the `credentials/` directory located in the project root.

    That's it. When you run `make install-system`, the installer will automatically:
    - Find your `.json` key file inside `credentials/`.
    - Copy it to the system-wide config directory for you.
    - Read the `project_id` from the file.
    - Update your `~/.config/mdaudiobook/.env` file with the correct path and project ID.

    This provides a seamless, zero-configuration setup for Google Cloud services.

3.  **Verify the Installation**

    You can now run `mdaudiobook` from anywhere. Check the version to confirm it's working:
    ```bash
    mdaudiobook --version
    ```

## üîß Usage

Once installed, `mdaudiobook` can be run directly on any Markdown file. The output `.m4b` file will be created in the same directory.

```bash
# Navigate to your document's directory
cd /path/to/my/documents/

# Generate an audiobook from a Markdown file
mdaudiobook my_document.md

# Use a specific processing mode (e.g., premium API)
mdaudiobook my_document.md --mode api
```

For development and batch processing, you can also use the `Makefile` targets from within the project directory:

```bash
# Process a single file using the Makefile
make audiobook SOURCE=path/to/document.md

# Process all documents in the `documents/` directory
make process-all
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`mdaudiobook` uses a 3-section YAML frontmatter at the top of your Markdown file, shared with `mdtexpdf`.

```yaml
---
# 1. Common Metadata (Used by both tools)
title: "The God Equation"
author: "Dr. Michio Kaku"
---
# 2. PDF-Specific Metadata (Ignored by mdaudiobook)
no_numbers: true
---
# 3. Audio-Specific Metadata (Used by mdaudiobook)
processing_mode: "hybrid" # basic, local_ai, api, hybrid
output_format: "m4b"      # m4b, mp3, wav
voices:
  main_narrator: "google_en-us-neural2-d"
  math_voice: "google_en-us-wavenet-c"
```

API keys and other sensitive data are managed in a `.env` file. Copy the example and add your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```
